A 3D visualization of the state variables S, N, and E for all data analyzed.

Each data point arranged in a 3D space of the logs of the state variables. If there were an obvious power law relationship between any of these variables, we would see the data collapse onto a straight line when viewed along a specific direction. Given that we do not see such a collapse, we assume that S, N, and E are not related, and we require an additional state variable in order to derive an equation of state.
