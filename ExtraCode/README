This folder again just has code I didn't end up using for the paper but that was quite useful.

BiomassDiversityRelationship_InitialPlots.ipynb is a way to try to plot the 4D equation of state in a single plot. This has a lot of test code and isn't super clean.

BiomassContours.ipynb is a clean version of my favourite plots from the above. It includes plots of contours of constant B/S for E/S and E/S, with a few different panels for different values of S.

BiomassContours_Pairwise.ipynb is a version that was to try to implement the above plots for each pairwise state variable, but it wasn't clear that this was going to result in good visuals.

EoverB34.ipynb plots how E/B^(3/4) varies with both S and N with a few different fixed values. This is intended to end up in the main text to explain what the relationship actually looks like.

Calc_richness.ipynb was an attempt to predict species richness from the other variables, rather than biomass. The log likelihood contours in S are very broad, so ti turns out this doesn't work very well. That isn't surprising becaus S has the weakest dependence in the model.

SNE3D_old.ipynb has 3d plots of S, N, and E, in addition to the movie in the main folder.

The two _old csvs are the state variable data from before we added more.
